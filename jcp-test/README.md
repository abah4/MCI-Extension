# Tasks

- Filter for links with a dollar amount in either the text of the link
  - We want things that end in ‘s’:

    <a href="#">Something something ends in s</a>

  - We DON’T want anything else.

- Print out the COMPLETE text for just matching nodes in two orders:
  - BFS order
  - DFS (traditional) order
